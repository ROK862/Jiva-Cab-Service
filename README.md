## Project Architecture
The Jiva cab service application follows a client-server architecture. The key components and technologies used in the project are as follows:

## Client-Side
Mobile App Development: The Jiva mobile app is developed using React Native, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications. React Native enables code reusability and provides a native-like experience on both Android and iOS devices.

User Interface (UI): The app's UI is designed using React Native components, styling, and navigation libraries. It offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with the app's features.

State Management: Redux, a predictable state container, is used for managing the app's global state. It helps in efficiently managing data flow and provides a centralized store for state management.

API Integration: The app integrates with backend services and APIs using libraries such as Axios or the Fetch API. It communicates with the server to handle user authentication, booking requests, real-time location tracking, and other interactions.

## Server-Side
Server Framework: The backend server is built using a server-side technology such as Node.js, Express.js, or another suitable framework. These frameworks allow efficient request handling, routing, and data processing.

Database: MongoDB is chosen as the database for storing various application data, including user profiles, ride details, driver information, and more. MongoDB's flexible schema and scalability make it a suitable choice for this project.

Push Notifications: The Expo Notifications API is utilized to send push notifications to users' devices. It allows real-time communication and keeps users updated about ride statuses, driver information, and important announcements.

Authentication and Security: User authentication and authorization are implemented using industry-standard protocols such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Security measures like encryption, validation, and input sanitization are applied to ensure data integrity and protect user information.
